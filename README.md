Hello World Guide

I am an extreemly lazy yet efficient person i would like to think. I try not to work harder than  i need to work because i don't see the value in doing things that you do not enjoy beyond how much you need to do them. However, i think that i will begin to feel bad about myself if i don not take the opportunity to work just a bit harder to make some advancements in my career and make some more money. My peers are begining to move forward so i think that is the impotus i need to work a bit harder.
